# Plan — index view

The plan is multi-level. **L0** fixes the goals; **L1** lists the work modules (one file each in
[`PLAN/`](PLAN/)); **L2/L3** live inside those files as concrete tasks with acceptance criteria.
Narrative progress is in [`JOURNAL.md`](JOURNAL.md); durable facts in [`MEMORY.md`](MEMORY.md).

## L0 — Goals

> See [`PLAN/00_goals.md`](PLAN/00_goals.md)

Deliver a coherent, *growing* set of course materials that carry a mathematically-mature but
formal-methods-new audience from the λ-calculus and type theory to the auto-formalization of research
mathematics — with every idea presented **informally (runnable) and formally (machine-checked)**.

## L1 — Work modules

| Module | File | Short description |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Landing page | [`PLAN/01_landing_page.md`](PLAN/01_landing_page.md) | `/vietnam2026` hero + 6-lecture plan + descriptions + cross-links; style of `classical-foundations-ann`. |
| Knowledge book | [`PLAN/02_knowledge_book.md`](PLAN/02_knowledge_book.md) | JupyterBook: the full text-friendly notes (maths + code + links) — the "learning data". |
| Obsidian vault | [`PLAN/03_obsidian_vault.md`](PLAN/03_obsidian_vault.md) | Atomic wiki-linked knowledge base; MOCs per lecture; source of truth for concepts. |
| Formal artifacts | [`PLAN/04_artifacts.md`](PLAN/04_artifacts.md) | Same statements in Lean / Agda / Rocq / Mizar — the four foundations, side by side. |
| Browser Lambda Lab | [`PLAN/05_browser_lab.md`](PLAN/05_browser_lab.md) | `lambda_lab` running client-side via Pyodide + xterm.js; deployed to `/lab-lambda`. |
| Slides | [`PLAN/06_slides.md`](PLAN/06_slides.md) | One reveal.js deck per lecture, to present live. |
| Research dossier | [`PLAN/07_research.md`](PLAN/07_research.md) | Depth, citations and current-landscape groundwork feeding every lecture. |
| Release & deploy | [`PLAN/08_deploy.md`](PLAN/08_deploy.md) | Git → GitHub → faculty server; incremental go-live; build/link checks. |
| Peano Lab | [`PLAN/09_peano_lab.md`](PLAN/09_peano_lab.md) | Sound browser theorem prover for PA: kernel → checked arithmetic tactics → UI → book/vault/corpus. |

## L2 / L3

Each `PLAN/*.md` file spells out **objectives**, **subtasks**, and **acceptance criteria**. Tasks are
checkboxes; keep them current as work lands. The through-line and prerequisite graph from the research
synthesis are the backbone the book and vault follow.

## Active Peano Lab milestone

M19 adds a compact headless adapter and a kernel-guided post-training experiment without changing
the prover's trust boundary. The JSONL runner reuses the production parser, surface tactics,
theorem library, proof engine, traces, and independent original-target finalizer. The pilot data,
replay compiler, fixed capability profile, BF16 LoRA runtime, evaluator provenance, guarded
Helios controls, and the first independently replay-attested 10,000-row synthetic release are
implemented. Helios training `20029970` completed 100 steps, but evaluator `20029980` failed before
generation on a manifest key-order bug. WMI typed-A100 probe `171369` also passed, and its independent
x86-64 base manifest, hash-locked overlay, transactional source controls, and one-shot safetensors
model-weight path are locally green. A trained adapter can now be used on an arbitrary bounded
closed PA formula through a second-kernel-replayed CLI and a ledgered immutable-request WMI A100
job. The corrected same-source WMI chain then passed preparation (`171414`), 100-step training
(`171421`), and held-out evaluation (`171423`). Its manifest records train/validation losses
0.7830/0.1362, but the kernel-judged result is 0/4 goals at pass@4. The earlier parity theorem also
failed at pass@16 (`171428`), while one fresh direct-witness theorem succeeded once in eight samples
and replayed to a seven-node kernel-checked proof (`171430`). This is a real within-template success,
but attribution to LoRA training awaits the pretrained-base baseline; the adapter is not yet a
dependable induction/order prover. The replacement experiment is now implemented as a distinct
`model-v2`: 45 permitted public theorems are bound by a full independently checked content identity,
while four benchmark theorems are sealed from imports and generated targets. Its proof-first
100,000-row schedule balances foundational, induction/IH, and library composition transitions at
2:1:1, covers all 25 tactic heads, and passes every selected row through a pinned-tokenizer
no-truncation gate. A bounded depth-32 search retries failed candidates at the same immutable state,
deduplicates canonical successors, and publishes only an original-target kernel QED. A persistent
cluster REPL uses that same search and then performs a second fresh replay before exposing a `.pa`
script. The final local/source gates and guarded Helios prepare→train→evaluate submission are in
progress; no model-v2 solve-rate claim exists until those jobs finish. See
[`PLAN/09_peano_lab.md`](PLAN/09_peano_lab.md). M18 remains the latest completed and staged
milestone; production remains untouched behind the M14 cache-header blocker.
