# Implementation diary

Short, dated notes on design decisions taken during implementation — the raw material for this
book part. Keep it as you go, not retroactively.

## 2026-07-26 — project start

Branch created; design document and milestone plan written. Decisions D1–D4 (staged logic,
proof terms + independent checker over LCF, trace format designed up front, intuitionistic core
with a classical toggle) recorded in `docs/PEANO_LAB_DESIGN.md` §0.

## 2026-07-27 — M0 representation choices

- The pinned parser API returns only a de Bruijn tree, not the surface free-name table.  Free
  names therefore receive indices in deterministic first-occurrence order; companion parsing
  helpers retain that table for the future UI.  Bound variables still use ordinary de Bruijn
  depth.  The canonical printer uses Unicode logical symbols and fresh deterministic binder names.
- `subst_term` and `subst_formula` mean *binder-opening* substitution: the selected slot is
  replaced, larger indices close the gap, and replacements shift under binders.  An internal/public
  `shift_formula` companion is necessary to express the quantifier and induction rules without
  capture.  Tests include the classic free-variable-under-`forall` counterexample.
- The certificate checker is bidirectional: introduction forms are checked against a target and
  elimination/equality forms synthesize their result.  This preserves the pinned unannotated proof
  constructors and keeps the trusted code small; certificates are kept in checkable normal form.
- Two architecture tensions are recorded rather than silently hidden.  `EqSubst` remains a kernel
  primitive because the API stub explicitly requires it, although design §1 also calls Leibniz
  substitution “derived”.  The required IND certificate for `forall x. x + 0 = x` deliberately
  exercises the schema but is logically redundant because PA3 is exactly that formula.
- **Objection for M3 review:** the binding design requires a classical DNE toggle, but the pinned
  kernel certificate language names only PA1–PA6 and has no DNE constructor.  The tactic layer
  cannot soundly add DNE by itself.  M3 will need an explicit, labeled kernel certificate form (and
  a checker mode or premise) before `classical on` can close any new theorem.
- An adversarial review found that Python subclasses could override an AST node's equality and fool
  an `isinstance`-based trusted recursion.  The checker now admits only the *exact* frozen kernel
  constructor classes at every boundary.  The concrete forged-`Zero`, forged-formula, and
  forged-proof attacks are permanent regression tests; this is a useful Python-specific extension
  of the De Bruijn criterion.

## 2026-07-27 — M1: holes, shared metavariables, and rewrite certificates

- `Hole` and `MetaVar` live in the untrusted engine as distinct subclasses of kernel `Proof` and
  `Term`.  The kernel's exact-constructor boundary therefore rejects either if finalization ever
  leaks one.  Globally unique IDs and copy-on-write substitutions follow the audited Lambda Lab
  pattern; each successful unifier is applied to every goal, context formula, and embedded term in
  the partial certificate, never to the original target or history snapshots.
- A partial certificate is one tree whose left-to-right holes correspond exactly to the goal tuple.
  Tactics replace only the focused hole.  `Step.state_before` stores the exact immutable transaction,
  so `undo` returns that object and a raised `TacticError` has nothing to roll back.
- M1 rewrites the first eligible occurrence in formula-left-to-right, term-preorder order.  The
  motive reserves de Bruijn index zero and capture-safely shifts every untouched variable.  Bodies
  of `forall`/`exists` are recognized but rejected until M3.  Forward rewriting of a goal inserts
  the *reverse* equality transport because the new subgoal must reconstruct the old target.
- Rewriting a hypothesis needs a sound local cut.  The engine derives the rewritten proposition,
  wraps the new hole in implication-introduction/elimination, and retains the old hypothesis under
  a fresh `_before` name so kernel hypothesis indices stay literal.  This exposed a completeness
  gap in M0's bidirectional checker: application of an introduction did not synthesize.  A small
  target-directed `ImpElim` case now validates this ordinary cut without trusting the engine.
- The M1 plan did not spell out how a context-free session could use PA3–PA6 before `specialize`
  arrives in M2.  `rewrite PA3` ... `rewrite PA6` therefore performs deterministic first-order
  pattern matching, emits explicit nested `ForallElim(Axiom(...), term)` certificates, and checks
  each instantiation.  This makes the required `S 0 + S 0` proof possible without a hidden evaluator.
- Trace records use one shared `?t1`, `?t2`, ... display map across sibling goals, stable v1 key
  order, canonical Unicode, no ANSI, and include failures.  Tracing remains an untrusted side effect;
  successful QED emits the specified footer only after the independent checker accepts.
- A second adversarial pass sharpened “original” into an API boundary.  A frozen state can still be
  replaced wholesale by buggy tactic code, including its cached `target`.  `checked_final` therefore
  requires the session owner's original formula as a separate argument, rejects a mismatching cache,
  and passes only the external original to the kernel.  M5's single-owner router must keep that value
  outside every tactic result.  The exact forged-target exploit is now in `test_soundness.py`.
- “Frozen” also has to be deep enough: a plain `dict` inside a frozen dataclass let callers mutate an
  undo snapshot through an alias.  States now copy substitutions into read-only mapping proxies and
  normalize all state collections to tuples.  Trace review similarly made metavariable aliases
  session-stable across before/after transitions and scrubbed ANSI from tactic/error fields too.
